Thank you for coming I had a blast, obviously. 
I first bought the tickets off of an Instagram ad and I sent it to Ethan. This was the first week of October ish.
We booked a ticket for you (as you know obviously) but at the time I was wondering who I would need to
give it to because there is no way we would still be together (I didnt do the math, but it felt like forever away.
That was the last time (I think) that that thought ever crossed my mind. I stopped worrying about the day to day
(for better or worse) and instead focused on more rational fears like hights. December at the time felt like infite
away, little did little me know how far it would really go... c'est incroyable. "
